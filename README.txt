Project: Penetration Testing Toolkit

Description:
This Python project is a simple toolkit for basic penetration testing. 
Right now, it has one working module: a Port Scanner.

What it does:
- Scans common ports like 21, 22, 80, 443, etc.
- Tells if each port is OPEN or CLOSED

Files in the project:
1. main.py → the main file that runs everything

How to use it:
1. Open main.py in Thonny
2. Run the file
3. Enter 1 to choose port scanner
4. Enter a target IP (like scanme.nmap.org)
5. You will see which ports are open
